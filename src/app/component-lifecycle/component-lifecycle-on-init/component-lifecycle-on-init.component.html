	<h1>OnInit</h1>

	<p class="paragraph">This is the second lifecycle hook method and is executed after the ngOnChanges hook method.</p>

	<p class="paragraph">The ngOnInit method runs after Angular has initialized all the components inputs with their initial values. A component's ngOnInit runs exactly once.</p>
	
	<p class="paragraph">This step happens before the component's own template is initialized. This means that you can update the component's state based on its initial input values.</p>

	<p class="paragraph">Use it for initialization logic, fetching initial data, or any setup that needs to happen once.</p>
